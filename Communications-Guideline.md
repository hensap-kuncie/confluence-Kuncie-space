    * Non-work and casual related  banter



    
*  **How to ask for urgency when sending message to Discord:** 

Please indicate the urgency of your message:


    * ASAP: if you need immediate response


    * \[By EOD]: if the response can wait until the end of day


    * \[By EOW]: if the response can wait until the end of week

##  ** ** [ **Server Boosting in Discord** ](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028038352-Server-Boosting-FAQ-)
 **What is Server Boosting in Discord?** 

Server Boosts is a feature that enables us to unlock some fresh, new and improved collective perks for a server each month and share those epic perks to the rest of the server community! A totally free-built server might be enough for most of the communities, but having these perks below might  **boost our productivity and makes our Discord experience more personal:** 

![](images/storage/Screenshot 2022-11-25 at 17.06.15.png) **Example:** We’ll get the  **Level 1 perks**  once there are  **2 server members**  boosting our server  **each month.** Runs the same for every level, we’ll get the  **Level 3 perks** once there are  **14 server members**  boosting our server  **each month.** 



 **💰A budget will be set for us to boost our server to Level 2. Server boosting will be handled by People Team.** 



 **I’m still interested to boost our server to the next level. How much does a Server Boost cost? 💰** 


* A server boost costs  **$4.99/month (approx. Rp 80.000/month)** or $59.88/year (approx. Rp 940.000/year).


* If you have Discord Nitro, you’ll get a 30% discount on server boosts with Discord Nitro, so a server boost with Discord Nitro will cost  **$3.49/month (approx. Rp 55.000/ month)** or $41.88/year (approx. Rp 660.000/year).





 **Will I be able to get a reimbursement for boosting Kuncie Team server? 💳** 


* Since this additional server boost is voluntary, the purchase of Server Boosts for our server won’t be reimbursed afterwards.


* However, if you still want to boost Kuncie Team server, please inform our People Team first, so it can be discussed further.
