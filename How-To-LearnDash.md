## 1.  Course Creation
Course Creation:

The structure and delivery of LearnDash courses is based on instructional design principles used in learning programs at Fortune 500 companies:


* The top-level is  **Course** .


* Below that you have  **Lessons** . Lessons are assigned to Courses. Lessons can optionally be grouped into  **Sections** .


* Below Lessons you have  **Topics** . Topics are assigned to Lessons just like Lessons are assigned to Courses.
