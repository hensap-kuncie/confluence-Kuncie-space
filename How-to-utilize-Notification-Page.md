Currently, to support the needs of users who are more real and close to them, we must have an innovations in app. Menus or features that may seem small but will have a real impact on them.

One of them is the Notification Page in the Kuncie App. This Notification page in the app will be of assistance to them, even though it is only a message box with a bell logo but will provide a journey to the user, what are the best lists from Kuncie that they may have missed or want to know all about the promo, the latest from mentor or from existing materials. It's like in the video below:

In this Notification Page we have several tabs in the menu:


* an All Tab where to bring up new modules and mentors which will appear when we publish on the CMS side.


* a Promo Tab which specifically informs users of interesting promos for users to be more enthusiastic about learning at Kuncie.


* a Module & Mentor Tab which specifically informs you of the existence of new modules and mentors that will appear when there is a publish action on the CMS side.
