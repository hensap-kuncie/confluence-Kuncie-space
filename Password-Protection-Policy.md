# 1. Overview
Passwords are an important aspect of computer security.  A poorly chosen password may result in unauthorized access and/or exploitation of our resources.  All staff, including contractors and vendors with access to Kuncie systems, are responsible for taking the appropriate steps, as outlined below, to select and secure their passwords. 


# 2. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a standard for creation of strong passwords and the protection of those passwords.


# 3. Scope
The scope of this policy includes all personnel who have or are responsible for an account (or any form of access that supports or requires a password) on any system that resides at any Kuncie facility, has access to the Kuncie network, or stores any non-public Kuncie information.

## 4.1. Password Creation
 **4.1.1.**  All user-level and system-level passwords must conform to the [[Password Construction Policy|Password-Construction-Policy]].

 **4.1.2.** Users must use a separate, unique password for each of their work related accounts. Users may not use any work related passwords for their own, personal account.

 **4.1.3.** User accounts that have system-level privileges granted through group memberships or programs such as sudo must have a unique password from all other accounts held by that user to access system-level privileges. In addition, it is highly required that some form of multi-factor authentication is used for all privileged accounts whenever available.


## 4.2. Password Change
 **4.2.1.** Passwords should be changed only when there is reason to believe a password has been compromised.

 **4.2.2.** Passwords are required to be changed every 6 months.


## 4.3. Password Protection
 **4.3.1.** Passwords must not be shared with anyone, including supervisors and coworkers. All passwords are to be treated as sensitive, Confidential Kuncie information.

 **4.3.3.** Passwords may be stored only in “password managers” authorized by the organization.

 **4.3.4.** Any user suspecting that his/her password may have been compromised must report the incident and change all passwords.


## 4.4. Application Development
Application developers must ensure that their programs contain the following security precautions:

 **4.4.1.** Applications must support authentication of individual users, not groups.

 **4.4.2.** Applications must not store passwords in clear text or in any easily reversible form.

 **4.4.3.** Applications must not transmit passwords in clear text over the network.
