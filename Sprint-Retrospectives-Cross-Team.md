By the closing of the sprint, we discuss together on how to improve teamwork by reflecting on what worked, what didn’t, and why.


##   Guideline
The retrospective is intended to improve us collectively as a team, so:


* Don’t make it personal, don’t take it personally


* Listen with an open mind


* Everyone’s experience is valid


* Set the time period you’re discussing (last sprint, last quarter, the entire project, etc.)


* Focus on improvement, rather than placing blame




##  Agenda

* Write (5 minutes)


* Share and discuss (30 minutes)


* Actionable items (10 minutes)
