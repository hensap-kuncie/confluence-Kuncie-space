## ¬†Retrospective
Add your Start doing, Stop doing, and Keep doing items to the table below. We'll use these to talk about how we can improve our process going forward.



|  **Name**  |  **What helped you forward this sprint?**  _Within a scope of BIZ & PDE collaborations_  |  **What slowing you down this sprint?**  _Within a scope of BIZ & PDE collaborations_  |  **What made you feel good this sprint?**  _Within a scope of BIZ & PDE collaborations_  |  **Any future risks ahead?**  _Within a scope of BIZ & PDE collaborations_  | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
|  | <ul><li> support in running our first BIZ x PDE alignment

</li></ul> | <ul><li>Scholarship Pertamina proposal absorbed 90% of my focus

</li><li>Some biz request are still ambiguous

</li></ul> | <ul><li>First time handling biz x pde, many things to improve. Just do it and iterate the process.

</li></ul> | <ul><li>the departure of zen master  at the end of this month

</li></ul> | 
|  | Other business stakeholder like from GTM and B2B are starting to comply with this new approach of collaboration | I observe that some PDE task are pending waiting for business context | 1 gate approach for prioritization seems to be working so far | There could be miscommunication if other streams are not involve directly during PDE planning and retro. We need to start involve them (and also the C level) starting in August | 
|  | Collaborative solutioning by all PDE team members. Using low-code platform with many limitations & unknown scope means that  **Scholarship Squad needs to do a lot of routine solutioning as a way to compensate acceptance criteria while still fulfilling usability requirements** alongside Appsmith limitations **. Shared ownership but separate responsibilities (between engineer, designer, QA, PM) make it works.**  Kudos & thank you üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  üíïüí™ | The horror imagery of doing painful migration from Appsmith to other solution, should we not succeed to start with sustainable & scalable architecture as a foundation, made me paranoid and caused delays in few decision-making. Sorry üôÉ | <ul><li>Tbh 's transparency & 's ability to always ask the right questions that triggers my thinking process.

</li><li>Shared ownership, separate responsibilities in Scholarship Squad üòéüôè (including Wiyan & Ais)

</li></ul> | <ul><li>Ditinggal 

</li><li>Unforeseeable B2B customization

</li></ul> | 
|  | Team member active discussion and collaboration throughout the shifting of new way of work  |  | Team capability and willingness on solutioning a minimum scope of work for experimenting that still covering the product objective of the initiatives | <ul><li>Vacant product leader to manage high-level product strategy.

</li></ul> | 
|  | squad member‚Äôs spirit and persistence to strive the best result for demo on last Thursday with 6 times daily internal demo with some improvement every day  Kudos for us that already make it happen guyss  And let‚Äôs make it better yaa |  | Finally, we can held Product Demo: Core Platform and get so many insight & meaningful discussion with other team that are very useful for our improvement. Thanks a lot your feedback guyss  | <ul><li>will miss the wisest man in product team 

</li><li>unforeseen error in production environment when releasing Core Platform

</li></ul> | 
|  | <ul><li>Clarity on priority tasks that needed to be developed across all domains.

</li><li>Visibility of the development progress and  blockers and limitations in the plan.

</li><li>All stakeholders understood, acknowledged, and discussed the priorities and development progress.

</li></ul> | <ul><li>Changes in priorities during the sprint caused disruptions and a need for better mitigation plans.

</li><li>Smoothly transitioning to other tasks when priorities shifted.

</li></ul> | The unity of understanding among stakeholders regarding priorities and the progress of development. | <ul><li>Potential clashes in priorities among different business teams.

</li><li>The need for better preparation and more detailed specifications from the business team before entering the development phase to avoid parallel development and inefficiencies.

</li></ul> | 
|  | Starting set priorities for each pillar ( praktis, executive, scholarship and core). Everyone aware that we have resources limitation. | Any discussion or meeting related non P0 project. Its quite absorb energy and time. | CORE DEMO! After all the roller-coaster. |  **Priority war** . Any business owners should starting have explicit value for proposal and projection with activities plan.  | 
|  | only focus on mobile platform, not too much switching |  | idem, not much context switching lately | <ul><li>multiple priorities across stream at the same period

</li><li>most developments in mobile app are only for short term (experiment), do our business have any other plan beside core platform in the long future?

</li></ul> | 
|  | quick and direct async alignment on our discord channel, improving our communication efficiency |  | transparent business direction to all project contributor (especially PDE team) regarding ‚Äúthe expected future‚Äù of our scholarship management services -> information delivered by PM btw, thanks to  | indirect information delivery from business to PDE contributors potentially create mis/incomplete information | 
|  | Casual discussion about customer needs, doesnt have to be a meeting, small discussion last Thru, with Dita & Bayu cud be more beneficial to improve CX |  | Async oriented | miss comm due to not having same context in mind, maybe we cud set async reminder/ silent meeting? still async but have more prominance. |
