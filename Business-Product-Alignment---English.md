note **Summary** 


* We will use the combination of  **Dual-track agile**  and  **LeSS framework**  to improve workflow and alignment between departments


* Business initiative proposal from business team should be explained in Business Requirement Documents and being discussed and reviewed together with product and designer team in the  **BRD Review meeting**  which scheduled beginning of the sprint


* These BRD proposal should be prepared at  _very late_  before the BRD review meeting starts


* Based on review and prioritization result in BRD review meeting, BRD proposal will be subject for research or feasibility assessment that will take  _at least_  1 sprint (2 weeks) 


* Hence, BRD proposal will  **only**  be proceed to development  _at earliest on the next sprint_  (not in the sprint where BRD were being discussed)


* This means that at earliest, the lead time from submission to delivery is at  _very least_ 2 sprints (1 month). (Could be longer depending on the scope)


* If there’s urgent initiatives that has conflicting priority and timeline with planned or ongoing initiative, business, product, and other stakeholders should have a consensus which planned or ongoing item that should be deprioritized, postponed or dropped completely

## Background

* As we experiment with 4 business units, we group those business units into 2 tribes


* These 2 tribes introduce new daily meeting cadence with the purpose to ensure alignment between department


* However, this new daily meeting cadence often used for business briefing which is not the right forum for point blank business inquiry or request to product, design and engineering


* After doing conducting some retrospective, we realized that this daily inquiry often causing disruption of planning and delivery between department especially when product, design, and engineering members are still shared across the tribes


* This mismatch between business cadence and product-design-engineer process also leads us to other issues such as:


    * Half-baked solution due to unvalidated problem space


    * Some members are showing symptom of burn out


    * Unclear constantly change of priority


    * More than 20% of our time are expended  _just_  for preparing weekly status update and attending the status update rather than doing the actual work



    
* Through this document, we’d like to address these issues by aligning the workflow between departments by adopting a proper agile framework (Please note that agile doesn’t necessarily means “rush”). 


* We also want to minimizing number of “status update overhead” meetings (that could have been an email) and switching it with meetings that produce a more tangible deliverables




## Objective

* Improve cross department alignment on initiatives that require product development


* Ensure clarity on priority (after all, if everything is urgent, nothing is)


* Reduce meetings that focus solely on status updates


* Improve team productivity and collaboration by doing a more interactive meeting/discussions and actual work




## Terminology
Please refer to this terminology table to understand the definition of some keywords in agile methodology.



|  **Term**  |  **Definition**  |  **Example**  | 
|  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| Dual track agile | Dual-track Agile is a product development methodology that sees a cross-functional team dividing its daily activities into two parallel tracks — discovery and delivery. | [https://www.bornfight.com/blog/dual-track-agile-the-what-the-why-the-pros-the-cons/](https://www.bornfight.com/blog/dual-track-agile-the-what-the-why-the-pros-the-cons/)[https://aktiasolutions.com/dual-track-agile/](https://aktiasolutions.com/dual-track-agile/) | 
| Discovery track(Problem exploration and validation) | The discovery track allows us to get to  **know and prioritise the needs of the users** . This lane focuses on learning quickly, validating or discarding ideas before developing them, continuing to measure and learning after launch, thus eliminating assumptions and ensuring that the product is viable and adds value to the user or business.In other words, it avoids wasting time and resources on products that the end user is not going to use, and it allows putting all the team effort into something safe. | <ul><li>Conduct stakeholder interviews

</li><li>User testing

</li><li>Co-design workshop

</li><li>Design new feature or addressing user testing feedback

</li><li>Perform market research (surveys, user interviews, etc.)

</li><li>Technical feasibility assessment, solutioning, and assessment

</li></ul> | 
| Delivery track (Product development) | The delivery track takes the learnings from the discovery lane and applies them to the final product. The development objective is to get the maximum number of improvements and complete functionalities possible during a sprint, which is known by the name of increment: the sum of all the tasks, use cases, requirements and any element that has been developed and they will be made available to the client in the end | <ul><li>Develop new features

</li><li>Refactoring

</li><li>Architecture and capacity planning

</li><li>Fix bugs and potential issues 

</li><li>Addressing technical debts

</li></ul> | 
| Scrum | Scrum is one of agile methodology that facilitate project management in a more structured approach within a (typically) 2 weeks time-box iteration (known as Sprint) | [https://www.gojek.io/blog/the-process-behind-program-management](https://www.gojek.io/blog/the-process-behind-program-management) | 
| [LeSS Framework](https://less.works/) | LeSS stands for Large-Scale Scrum. It’s a framework that allows scaling the collaboration of multiple teams that run Scrum process to ensure alignment between team | [https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/less](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/less) | 
| Kanban | Kanban is a popular Lean workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving services that deliver knowledge work. It helps you visualize work, maximize efficiency, and improve continuously. Work is represented on Kanban boards, allowing you to optimize work delivery across multiple teams members in a single environment. | ![](images/storage/image-20220830-053315.png) | 
| BRD/RFP | BRD stands for Business Requirement Document. Document that describe the business case proposal that may require prioritization in product development. It should provide the problem that we need to solve, the objective that we need to achieve and what is the business value in solving those problem.BRD is also known as RFP: Request for Proposal.  | [[BRD Template - English|BRD-Template---English]] | 
| PRD/PFD | PRD stands for Product Requirement Documents. It's a guide that defines a particular product’s requirements, including its purpose, features, functionality, and behavior.This document is generally written by the Product Manager to communicate  **what** they are building,  **who** it is for, and  **how** it benefits the end-user.  | [[Netcore Integration : The Nudges Feature|Netcore-Integration---The-Nudges-Feature]] | 
| R.I.C.E Framework | A framework of assessing priority that considering 4 factors:  **R** each,  **I** mpact,  **C** ost, and  **E** ffort.Formula of calculating R.I.C.E score = ( **R** each x  **I** mpact x  **C** ost) /  **E** ffort | [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JZ6vuL7WfSGMytqj1UZ_4tVwGupo2L8-hSyiPVZ146s/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JZ6vuL7WfSGMytqj1UZ_4tVwGupo2L8-hSyiPVZ146s/edit#gid=0) | 




## How this workflow works?

* The  _discovery track_  identifies the problem, works on solutions, creates prototypes, tests them and then when the prototype is validated, goes to the  _delivery track_  where product development begins.


* Discovery and delivery track are run parallel in the same 2 weeks time box,  **_but_**  the topics that are being executed in  _discovery track_  **are always one sprint ahead**  before being transferred to development execution in  _delivery track_ .


* After the validated “topic” goes to delivery track, the discovery process can start exploring and validating new topic/problems and the cycle starts again.


* This process is in line with the agile concept:  _Continuous problem finding, continuous value delivery_ 


    * Discovery: (how to decide to) build the right thing


    * Delivery: (how can we) build the things right

## Why should we adopt this framework? what’s the benefit for us?

* This methodology facilitates the coexistence of business, design, UX and development objectives and improves communication and understanding between teams. 


* On the other hand, it increases efficiency thanks to the integration and optimization of the research and testing stages, and because all the ideas that enter the backlog are already validated, they only need to be prioritized and estimated.


*  All of this enables quick iterations on the product that add direct value to the end user and promote design based on data collected on product usage.




## How can we adopt this workflow at Kuncie?

1. Business team can bring their prioritized proposal (Business Requirement Documents) in the  **BRD meeting**  forum


1. Business team can go through and present to the team about each of the business initiatives


1. Product Managers can facilitate the discussion and together with the Design lead, Researchers and Tech lead can ask clarification question to the business team


1. PM and Design lead  **classify**  the initiatives based on the clarity and the confidence of the problem


1. The  _discovery track_  can be classify into two type of works: 


    *  **Exploration** . In this phase we can start from an idea or a problem, reformulating or restructuring them to achieve a business objective or increasing the value for users. During  **exploration** , we seek to understand the problem with qualitative and quantitative data through interviews with users, surveys, net promoter score (NPS) comments, product use and heat maps. After collecting the data, designers can define the problem and think up solutions,  with the target users in mind. The team will then be ready to define a value proposition and prototypes.


    *  **Validation** . Once we have the prototypes, we look to validate their desirability, usability or feasibility with both users and the development team. It is a cycle of continuous improvement from which we gather knowledge, the necessary changes are made and we start again. When a final validated idea is reached – which does not necessarily imply a new product, but can also be a test of a concept, a usability improvement or a technical feasibility solution – it goes to the development team to begin implementation.



    
1. All of the initiatives then being prioritised together (using R.I.C.E framework)


1. Before  **BRD Review**  wrapping up the meeting, make sure to have a consensus on:


    * which initiatives that will be executed in  _discovery track_ sprint


    * what initiatives to be deprioritized, postponed or dropped  **if**  there’s a conflict of priority or urgent task needs to be inserted into the ongoing sprint (not recommended)



    
1. Any initiatives that has been processed through  _discovery track_  doesn’t guarantee that it will goes into the development ( _delivery track_ ) depending on the discovery result


1. Once the initiatives are validated, then it can be transferred into developers to start the development in  _delivery track_  with the reassurance that they are dedicating their time and effort with high confidence.



This workflow can be visualized in the following diagram:

![](images/storage/Cross stream wrokflow.jpg)


### How it will look like on my calendar?

* The following are example of how both discovery meetings and delivery meetings meeting would be scheduled in one month


* The topic/problems/initiative is always being explored and validated in  _Discovery track_  2 weeks in advance before being executed in development ( _Delivery track_ )


* But Discovery track and Delivery track will run in parallel with different topic/problem/initaitive to work on. 


    * Discovery track will starts exploring and validating problem for the next sprint


    * While Delivery track is executing the validated ideas from the previous Discovery track findings



    
* This way, we can have a continuous  _discovery_  (build the right things) and  _delivery_  (build the things right) process.


* Business team will only need to attend the blue ones.

## What if there’s an urgent issue arise in the middle of the ongoing sprint?

1. PMM or Business PIC can mention the issue during daily standup tribe; but please refrain to demand solution right on the spot because the issue needs to be assessed first


1. PMM or Business PIC can find available slot for huddle with PM and a technical representative on that day to discuss about the issue in details


1. PM (with the support from engineer) will assess if the issue can be inserted in the ongoing sprint or not either:


    1. during the discussion or


    1. require separate discussion with engineer (without PMM)



    
1. The solution effort to be explored by PM and engineer should be small enough to be inserted in the ongoing sprint or leverage 3rd party service if necessary


1. If the effort of the urgent task is big and could delay the ongoing items being develop in ongoing sprint, then PM needs to escalate to leaders (CEO/COO, Head of Product and Head of Business) and ensure consensus on whether:


    1. to delay ongoing items on the sprint to give space of the urgent task or 


    1. the urgent task can wait if compare to the ongoing task

## Things to be considered during BRD review 

### PM to check with business and design

* Is this in support of a company or team  **OKR** ?


* Does it bring our  **vision**  closer to reality?


* Does it meaningfully improve the user experience of an important workflow?


* Is it customer  **needs**  or  _just_  our  **wants** ?


* Is it particularly  **important for customers** ?




### PM to check with tech lead

* The technical complexity is acceptable. We want to preserve our ability to make changes quickly in the future so we try to avoid complex code, complex data structures, and optional settings.


* It is orthogonal to other features (prevents overlap with current and future features).


* The requirements are clear.


* It can be achieved within the scheduled milestone. Larger issues should be split up, so that individual steps can be achieved within a single milestone.
